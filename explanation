In this modified version, we define a new method called get_sort_key within the DetailsSorter class. 
This method returns a tuple containing the name, age, and score of a person, which will be used as the sorting key.

Instead of using the itemgetter function, we pass the self.get_sort_key method as the sorting key to the sorted() function. 
This allows us to achieve the same sorting based on the name, age, and score of each person.

By making these changes, we eliminate the need for importing the operator module and the itemgetter function, 
while still achieving the desired sorting functionality.


Certainly! Here's an explanation of each line in the modified code along with examples:


class DetailsSorter:
This line defines a class called DetailsSorter that will handle the sorting of details.


    def __init__(self):
        self.details_list = []
The __init__ method is the constructor for the DetailsSorter class. It initializes an empty list called details_list, 
which will be used to store the details entered by the user.


    def add_details(self, details):
        self.details_list.append(details)
The add_details method allows adding details to the details_list. It takes a parameter called details,
which should be a tuple containing the name, age, and score of a person. 
The method appends the details tuple to the details_list.


    def get_sort_key(self, details):
        return (details[0], details[1], details[2])
The get_sort_key method is defined to return a tuple containing the name, age, and score of a person. 
This method will be used as the sorting key. It takes a parameter called details, which is a tuple containing the details of a person.
The method accesses the elements of the details tuple by their indices and returns them as a tuple.


    def sort_details(self):
        sorted_list = sorted(self.details_list, key=self.get_sort_key)
        return sorted_list
The sort_details method sorts the details_list based on the name, age, and score of each person.
It uses the sorted() function and specifies the sorting key as self.get_sort_key. 
This means that the sorting will be done based on the tuple returned by the get_sort_key method. 
The sorted list is stored in the sorted_list variable, which is then returned.


details_sorter = DetailsSorter()
An instance of the DetailsSorter class is created and assigned to the variable details_sorter.


while True:
    input_str = input("Enter Details: (Name, Age, Score) [Press Enter to end]: ")
    if not input_str:
        break
    details = tuple(input_str.split(","))
    details_sorter.add_details(details)
This code block creates a loop that continues until the user enters an empty string. 
It prompts the user to enter details in the specified format (name, age, and score). 
The input string is split by comma using the split(",") method, which returns a list of individual details.
The tuple() function is then used to convert the list into a tuple. The add_details method of the details_sorter object is called to add
the details tuple to the details_list.


sorted_details = details_sorter.sort_details()
The sort_details method of the details_sorter object is called to sort the details. The sorted details are assigned to the variable sorted_details.


print(sorted_details)
Finally, the sorted details are printed to the console.
I hope this explanation helps clarify how each line of the modified code works. Let me know if you have any further questions!



In the given code, the execution starts from the line:


details_sorter = DetailsSorter()
This line creates an instance of the DetailsSorter class and assigns it to the variable details_sorter. 
This instantiation triggers the execution of the __init__ method within the DetailsSorter class, which initializes the details_list attribute.

After creating the instance, the code proceeds to the following block:


while True:
    input_str = input("Enter Details: (Name, Age, Score) [Press Enter to end]: ")
    if not input_str:
        break
    details = tuple(input_str.split(","))
    details_sorter.add_details(details)
This block creates an infinite loop using while True. Within the loop, the user is prompted to enter details in the specified format.
If the user inputs an empty string (presses Enter), the loop is broken using the break statement.

For each non-empty input, the code splits the input string by commas using input_str.split(","). 
The resulting list of details is converted to a tuple using tuple() and assigned to the variable details.
The add_details method of the details_sorter object is then called to add the details tuple to the details_list attribute.

Once the user ends the input by entering an empty string, the execution continues to the next line:


sorted_details = details_sorter.sort_details()
This line calls the sort_details method of the details_sorter object. The method performs the sorting based on the provided sorting key and 
returns the sorted list of details. The sorted list is assigned to the variable sorted_details.

Finally, the execution proceeds to the last line:


print(sorted_details)
This line prints the sorted list of details to the console.

So, the execution starts with the instantiation of the DetailsSorter object and follows through the input loop,
sorting the details, and then printing the sorted details.
